<h1>Interacting</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add complexity to the game by adding a method to the location objects we created. </li>
    <li>Invoke the method whenever the player visits that location object. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now that a player is able to walk around our map of the Hundred Acre Wood, let's make the game a little more interesting by giving the characters in the homes a chance to speak. We can add methods to an object by creating an attribute that has an anonymous function for a value. The function can be anonymous, or without a name, because it will use the key as a name. 
Add a greet method to each of the home objects in your code and invoke them whenever the player visits a home.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add a greet method to each of the objects on the map</li>
    <li>Adjust the move function so that it invokes the greet method of the player's location </li>
</ul>
